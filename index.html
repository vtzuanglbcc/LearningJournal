          For this first week of PHP/MySQL, I learned the very basics of
          PHP. I didn't realize previously that PHP required a webserver
          to function. And that PHP code was actually written into a file
          that very much resembles a HTML document, but is saved with the 
          PHP file name extension. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a link to what we worked on in <a href="https://cosw30-lab1.victortzuang.repl.co/">Week 1</a>. It's a website written
          in PHP that utilizes the PHP echo statement to display a website. The echo
          statements produce the HTML code which is displayed. I would like to improve
          on CSS and I tried to incorporate some CSS properties I found on W3Schools
          into that website.
        
        </p>
        <p>
          It was very interesting that single and double quotes mean different
          things in PHP. Content within singles quotes are not interpreted but
          instead are displayed literally. For example, in this:
        </p>
        <pre>
                
                  $car = "Camry"; 
                  $color = "blue";
                  echo 'My $car is $color.";
                  echo "My $car is $color.";
                  
        </pre>
        <p>
           the first echo statement will display 'My $car is $color.'. Meanwhile,
          the second echo will display "My Camry is blue".

        <p>This week, I went through some of the W3Schools's CSS learning materials. I 
          thought the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border_rounded.asp">border-radius property</a>
          was really useful to make rounded borders. There were also some CSS topics such
          as tooltips, font-weight, and font-style. The tooltips I felt can be used to make 
          a very artistic website and I hope to utilize them. The resize property allows the user to
          resize an element. The property value of resize can be none, both, horizontal, or vertical. Here, this
          div is set for horizontal resizing:
        </p>
        <div class="resize">When the CSS resize property is set to horizontal, this div
          can be minimized horizontally but not vertically.
        </div>
