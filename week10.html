 <p>
     This week, we focused on learning cookies and sessions. Since the web is stateless, cookies and sessions are useful in creating state so that when a user logs in, we know that that user is logged in and can display data that is specific to that user. When the user logs out, then that data cannot be displayed. Cookies are stored on the browser while sessions are on the server. 
 </p><p>
The general idea of cookies and sessions is as follows. The user goes to a login page and enters in their information such as email and password. Then, if the form is complete, the data is sent to the database. If the email and password match one and only one row, then that is a good match. When that occurs, the user is logged in and the cookie is set or the session started. If the email and password are not a match or match more than one row, then there is a problem and the user is not logged in. In the latter case, the user can be redirected back to the login page. We also added a logout page, where the cookies or session data is  cleared. 
 </p><p>
Two functions were created this week to assist with the process of logging in. The first function was to redirect the user to a particular website. This function can take one argument which is the page to be redirected to. The default website it redirects to is index.php.
</p><blockquote><pre>

		function  redirect_user($page = 'index.php')  {
			
			$url = 'http://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']);
			
			$url = rtrim($url, '/\\');
			$url .= '/' . $page;

			header(“Location: $url”);
			exit();

		}
</pre></blockquote><p>
The code above creates an url with the http host and the directory name of the current website location. The dirname() truncates off the name of the current page. Then the rtrim() trims off both any backslashes or forward slashes from the right side of the url. Then, a backslash is added and the page name is added. The header() function then redirects the user to the absolute url that was created. Then the script is quit with the exit() function. 
 </p><p>
The second function we created checks to make sure the user entered in a valid email and password combination to login. 
</p><blockquote><pre>

		function check_login($connection, $email = '', $pass = '') 
</pre></blockquote><p>
Within this function, we check to make sure $email and $pass are not empty, and if they are not empty, we save the $email as $email = mysqli_real_escape_string($connection, trim($email)). The same is done with the password, such that $password = mysqli_real_escape_string($connection, trim($password));. Then, if there are no errors such as missing email or password, the query is created. The query created in this instance is “SELECT user_id, first_name FROM USERS WHERE email='$email' and password='$pass';. The $pass variable here is $pass = hash('sha512', $pass) and the result of the query is $result = @mysli_query($connection, $query). We then check to make sure that only one and only one row was returned. This is done by 
</p><blockquote><pre>
	      
		if(mysqli_num_rows($result) == 1) {
			$row = mysqli_fetch_array($result, MYSQLI_ASSOC);
			return[true, $row];
		}
</pre></blockquote><p>
The one row is then returned as the second element of an array; the first element being true in that the query was successful. The $row can then be accessed for the user_id and first_name from the database. In our case, the list() function is used to store the returned values in separate variables. 
 </p><p>
The book notes that it is important to make sure that cookies are sent from the server to the client before any other information. If the server tries to send the cookie after the browser has already gotten HTML, then a “headers already sent” error occurs. 
 </p><p>
The return value of the check_login() function is stored in two variables as such: list($check, $data) = check_login($connection, $_POST['email'], $_POST['pass']. Now, the $data array variable contains the row returned from the database and can be used to set cookie values.
 </p><p>
To set a cookie's value use setcookie('user_id', $data['user_id']). Now, the value of $_COOKIE['user_id'] can be accessed. The isset() function can be used to check if the value of the cookie is set. The setcookie() function actually has more parameters:
</p><blockquote><pre>

		setcookie(name, value, expiration, path, host, secure, httponly);
		
</pre></blockquote><p>
If expiration is set to time()+3600, that means the cookie expires in 60 minutes. Path can be set to '/' and host to ''. To delete a cookie, you can do setcookie('first_name', '', time()-3600, '/', '', 0, 0);.
 </p><p>
Switching to sessions, we learned that to start a session, you use the function session_start(). Like cookies, sessions need to be started before any data goes to the browser. When you start a session, a cookie with name PHPSESSID and a hex value is stored on the browser. After the session starts, you can set values by using $_SESSION['first_name'] = $data['first_name']. 
 </p><p>
The book emphasizes how each script must first enable sessions with session_start(). This gives the script access to the session so it can read the session variables such as $_SESSION['first_name']. 
 </p><p>
The book also showed an interesting technique to change the page navigation links based on whether the user is logged into a session. By using if(isset($_SESSION['user_id'])), if the user has the SESSION variable for user_id set, then we can show a Logout link. Otherwise, we show a Login link.
 </p><p>
To remove session data such as when the user logouts, we use 
</p><blockquote><pre>

		$_SESSION = []; 	//to clear the variables  
		session_destroy(); 	// to stop the session
		setcookie('PHPSESSID', '', time()-3600, '/', '', 0, 0); 		//delete session cookie 

</pre></blockquote><p>
All these three steps are needed. So you need to clear the session variables, stop the session, and delete the session cookie on the user's browser.
 </p><p>
The book warns us to not set $_SESSION to NULL and to not use unset($_SESSION). This can cause server problems. 
 </p><p>
For improving security of sessions, we create the following SESSION variable:
</p><blockquote><pre>
	      
		$_SESSION['agent'] = sha1($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']);

</pre></blockquote><p>
Then, for pages where the user must be logged into a session, we can check whether the $_SESSION['agent'] is set and whether this session agent value is equal to that other pages' sha1($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']). This prevents another user from accessing the session if they are using a different browser or operating system. 
 </p><p>
The book also talks about session_regenerate_id() which provides a new session ID when a user logs in. 
	 </p><p>
	     
	      
	     
	      
	      
	      
	      
	      
	      To safeguard email, we need to make sure there are characters that are not in the body of the email. These include content-type:, mime-version:, bcc:, and also newline characters such as \r, \n, and %0a and %0d. To do this, the book shows a function called spam_scrubber($value) which takes in the $_POST variable as the $value. This is done using array_map('spam_scrubber', $_POST). Since we are not calling the spam_scrubber function, there is no parenthesis. Basically, the array_map() causes every $_POST variable to be put through the spam_scrubber function. 
</p><p>
In the spam_scrubber function, we create an array of very bad strings such as 'cc:' or 'to:'. Then, we use a foreach loop such that if the very bad value is in the $_POST variable as represented by $value, then an empty string is returned and stop working.
</p><blockquote><pre>
		foreach ($very_bad as $v) {     	// each item in $very_bad is referenced as $v
			if (stripos($value, $v) !== false {
				return '';
			}
		}
</pre></blockquote><p>
The stripos() function searches for $v in $value, and it returns true if it finds $v in $value. So if stripos() returns true, then it returns an empty string which would cause the $POST variable value to be an empty string. 
</p><p>
Then, for carriage returns and newlines, str_replace() is used. str_replace() looks in $value and if it finds the elements in the array such as \n or \r, it will be replaced by a space.
</p><blockquote><pre>
		$value = str_replace( [“\r”, “\n”, “%0a”, “%0d”], ' ' , $value);
</pre></blockquote><p>
After running through the $_POST variable through the spam_scrubber() function by using $scrubbed = array_map('spam_scrubber', $_POST), we only use the $scrubbed array and not the $_POST array. So instead of $_POST['name'], we use $scrubbed['name'].The book then says it probably wasn't necessary to put all the $_POST variables through the spam_scrubber() such as $_POST['submit'], but it didn't cause problems to do this either.
</p><p>
The book then reviews functions that check types. For exmaple, is_array() checks to make sure the variable is an array, and if it is, returns TRUE. 
</p><p>
Also, there are two validation approaches: whitelist and blacklist. Whitelist lets us say that these values are good, and everything else is bad. Meanwhile, blacklist has us say these values are bad, and everything else is good. The email spam check was a blacklist validation. 
</p><p>
Typecasting forces a type onto a variable. For example, if $quantity = 14.4, then echo (int) $quantity; will echo 14. 
</p><p>
The book also says that HTML5 validation can be bypassed by putting novalidate attribute in the opening form tag. Because of this, you cannot rely solely on HTML5 form validation. When we typecast values, we can make sure the data is in the appropriate type. If the type is incorrect, the typecasting will result in 0. Thus, in the calculator example, then you typecast $quantity = (int) $_POST['quantity'], if the post value is somehow not a number, it will be typecast to 0 and the next conditional to check if $quantity > 0 will fail. A function called number_format($price, 2) outputs the $price to two decimal points. The HTML form also uses an attribute of step with value of “1” for integer values and .01 for decimal values.
</p><p>
It is also important to typecast numbers for SQL queries because if a string is entered, there will be a SQL syntax error. If you typecast to (int) or (float) for numbers, the SQL query should not have a syntax error for what should be numbers although it will probably not return the correct result. The book says that this type validation is simpler but regular expressions are probably a better choice.
</p><p>
XSS is cross-site scripting and to prevent XSS you need to look for dangerous HTML, Javascript and PHP code. PHP has functions such as htmlspecialchars(), htmlentities(), and strip_tags() to deactivate XSS. Htmlspecialchars() will change some characters such as the less than sign and greater than sign into the HTML entity format that starts with the ampersand, while htmlentities() does it with all characters, and strip_tags() gets rid of all HTML and PHP tags.
</p><p>
To prevent SQL injection attacks, use mysqli_real_escape_string() to make the data safe for the database query. Also, prepared statements can be used as well.

	      <p class='supplemental'>Supplemental Learning</p>
	      <p>
	For the supplemental learning this week, I took the opportunity to learn more CSS. Oftentimes when styling a website, I run into the problem of not being able to center something. Eventually, after looking online and trying various techniques and ending up with a somewhat cluttered stylesheet, the item is centered but I am thinking there must be a better way to do this. While browsing CSS Tricks, I found a useful <a href='https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/'>resource</a> that goes through centering. 
	      </p><p>
The guide breaks it down very well and I didn't realize centering depended on whether the element was inline or block. If it's inline and you want to center horizontally, use text-align: center. If it's block, use margin: 0 auto.  
  </p><p>
Vertical centering is more difficult. I think for vertical centering, it makes sense to use flexbox. You set the parent div to display: flex, with flex-direction: column and justify-content: center. I think this resource will be helpful in the future to refer back to when I have problems centering items. Because it breaks down whether you want to center horizontally or vertically, and then whether the elements are inline or block, it makes it easy to see which particular case you are working with.
