          This week I reviewed array_rand() which is a function that takes in 
          an array and the number of random keys you want to generate from that 
          array. 
        </p>
        <blockquote><pre>
            $keys_returned = array_rand($arrayName, <number of random keys to generate>);
        </pre></blockquote>
        <p>
          The function returns the keys either as a number or as an array of 
          numbers. I noticed that if I did not specify the number of random
          keys to generate, it would only return one key in the form of a number.
          Meanwhile, if I specified the number of keys to return between 2 and
          the count($arrayName), it would return an array with random values
          which represented the keys of the $arrayName. Lastly, if I chose
          the number of keys to be generated to be greater than count($arrayName),
          nothing would be returned and it was NULL. Here is an example:
        </p>
        <blockquote><pre>
                  $cookies = ["chocolate chip", "sugar", "peanut butter", "almond"];

                  $random_keys = array_rand($cookies, 2);
      
                  echo $random_keys;                // returns Array  
                  print_r($random_keys);            // returns Array ( [0] => 0 [1] => 1 )
      
                  echo $cookies[$random_keys[0]];   // chocolate chip
                  echo "<br>";
                  echo $cookies[$random_keys[1]];   // sugar
                  echo "<br>";
                  echo $cookies[$random_keys[2]];   //no output because only 2 keys generated
        </pre></blockquote>
        <p>
          To further illustrate, if the function was called with array_rand($cookies, 1) or simply array_rand($cookies),
          then only one key would be returned would be one integer value. Meanwhile, if the number
          of keys generated was greater than 2 and less than count($cookies), an array was returned.
          Lastly, NULL is returned when the entries requested to be picked is greater than 
          count($cookies).
        </p>
        <blockquote><pre>
                  $random_keys = array_rand($cookies);
                  echo gettype($random_keys);           // integer
                  $random_keys = array_rand($cookies, 2);
                  echo getttype($random_keys);          // array
                  $random_keys = array_rand($cookies, count($cookies) + 1);
                  echo getttype($random_keys);          // NULL
        </pre></blockquote>
        <p>
          I thought it was really interesting to investigate the behavior of $random_keys(). A unusual
          thing I noticed is that if you do array_rand($cookies, count($cookies)), you actually do
          not get random keys. Instead, you end up with this for the $random_keys array:
        <blockquote><pre>
                  Array ( [0] => 0 [1] => 1 [2] => 2 [3] => 3 [4] => 4 [5] => 5 [6] => 6 )
        </pre></blockquote>
        <p>
          Because of this behavior, it would not make sense to generate an array of
          random keys using this function if you are expecting to get an array of random keys 
          that has the same number of elements as your original array. Instead, shuffle() makes
          more sense. Shuffle() will shuffle all the values of an array and possibly all the values
          will have new and different keys.
