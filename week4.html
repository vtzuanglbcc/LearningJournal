        <h3>Week 4</h3>
        <p>
          <time datetime="2021-09-24">September 24 2021</time>
        </p>
        <p>
          This week I reviewed array_rand() which is a function that takes in an
          array and the number of random keys you want to generate from that
          array.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
$keys_returned = array_rand($arrayName, 
&lt;number of random keys to generate&gt;);
        </pre
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The function returns the keys either as a number or as an array of
          numbers. I noticed that if I did not specify the number of random keys
          to generate, it would only return one key in the form of a number.
          Meanwhile, if I specified the number of keys to return between 2 and
          the count($arrayName), it would return an array with random values
          which represented the keys of the $arrayName. Lastly, if I chose the
          number of keys to be generated to be greater than count($arrayName),
          nothing would be returned and it was NULL. Here is an example:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
  $cookies = ["chocolate chip", "sugar", "peanut butter", "almond"];

  $random_keys = array_rand($cookies, 2);

  echo $random_keys;                // returns Array  
        print_r($random_keys);            // returns Array ( [0] => 0 [1] => 1 )

  echo $cookies[$random_keys[0]];   // chocolate chip
        
  echo $cookies[$random_keys[1]];   // sugar
        
        echo $cookies[$random_keys[2]];   //no output because only 2 keys generated
        </pre
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          To further illustrate, if the function was called with
          array_rand($cookies, 1) or simply array_rand($cookies), then only one
          key would be returned would be one integer value. Meanwhile, if the
          number of keys generated was greater than 2 and less than
          count($cookies), an array was returned. Lastly, NULL is returned when
          the entries requested to be picked is greater than count($cookies).
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
            $random_keys = array_rand($cookies);
            echo gettype($random_keys);           // integer
            $random_keys = array_rand($cookies, 2);
            echo getttype($random_keys);          // array
            $random_keys = array_rand($cookies, count($cookies) + 1);
            echo getttype($random_keys);          // NULL
        </pre
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I thought it was really interesting to investigate the behavior of
          $random_keys(). A unusual thing I noticed is that if you do
          array_rand($cookies, count($cookies)), you actually do not get random
          keys. Instead, you end up with this for the $random_keys array:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <pre>
              Array ( [0] => 0 [1] => 1 [2] => 2 [3] => 3 [4] => 4 [5] => 5 [6] => 6 )
        </pre
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Because of this behavior, it would not make sense to generate an array
          of random keys using this function if you are expecting to get an
          array of random keys that has the same number of elements as your
          original array. Instead, shuffle() makes more sense. Shuffle() will
          shuffle all the values of an array and possibly all the values will
          have new and different keys. Then, you can just output the first
          element of that shuffled array and expect to get a randomized element.
        </p>
        <p>
          This week we also explored array_search(). Array_search() takes a
          value to search for as the first parameter, and the array to search
          for in the second parameter. Here is an example:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
          $ingredients = ["chocolate chip", "sugar", "peanut butter", "almond" ,"coffee", "tea", "butter"];

          echo array_search("tea", $ingredients);                   // prints 5
          var_dump( array_search("peanut", $ingredients) );         // prints bool(false)
          echo array_search("peanut butter", $ingredients);         // prints 2
          var_dump ( array_search("peanut butter", $ingredients) ); // prints int(2)

          $myNull = null;
          echo '$myNull is' . $myNull;      // prints $myNull is
          var_dump($myNull);                // prints NULL
         </pre
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Since "tea" is in the $ingredients array, the array_search() returns
          the integer 5 because "tea" is at index 5 in $ingredients. Meanwhile,
          "peanut" is not in the array so simply using echo on that
          array_search() result will not print anything. I tried using
          var_dump() and it prints bool(false). So if the array_search() does
          not find the value in the array, it returns false. Lastly, I was
          curious about var_dump() for null values. PHP will var_dump a null
          value as NULL, while the previous var_dump() for the
          array_search("peanut", $ingredients) was bool(false). It is useful
          that var_dump() allows the user to see what echo is not able to
          display.

        <p>
          While exploring different PHP array functions, array_intersect looked
          like it could be quite useful if you wanted to find all the elements
          that are shared between two arrays. The return value is an Array that
          contains the shared values and the keys are based on the keys of the
          first array argument. So if you reverse the arguments, then the keys
          will be different unless the positions of the values are the same in
          both arrays. Here is an example:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
            $ingredients = ["chocolate chip", "sugar", "peanut butter", "almond" ,"coffee", "tea", "butter", "strawberry"];
            $icecream = ["chocolate chip", "vanilla", "coffee", "strawberry"];

            $intersect = array_intersect($ingredients, $icecream);
            print_r($intersect);                          //Array ( [0] => chocolate chip [4] => coffee [7] => strawberry ) 

            $intersect = array_intersect($icecream, $ingredients);
            print_r($intersect);                          // Array ( [0] => chocolate chip [2] => coffee [3] => strawberry )
          </pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I think array_intersect() would be useful if you wanted to find
          matching values in two arrays and you wanted to easily work with those
          values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Array_sum() caught my attention and I thought it could be very useful:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
            $icecream = ["chocolate chip", "vanilla", "coffee", "strawberry"];
            $sum = array_sum($icecream);
            echo $sum;                            // 0

            $mixed = ["apple", 3, 4, 5, "cherry", 10];
            $sum = array_sum($mixed);
            echo $sum;                            // 22

            $mixed = ["tree", 3.1415, -22, 100, "hello", "world", "50", "1000"];
            $sum = array_sum($mixed);
            echo $sum;                            // 1131.1415
          </pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          When the array is all alphabetical strings, then the array_sum()
          returns zero on that array. Then, I tried mixed type arrays and it
          appears to only add the integers. Finally, I had a mixed array with
          strings, float, integers, and also strings like "50" which can be
          converted to numbers. It turns out PHP converts these numeric strings
          into numbers, and adds them to the sum as well. This behavior is very
          interesting and may be useful especially in adding together user input
          that may all be in strings. This means you do not need to convert user
          string input into numbers to add them, yet you do not need to worry
          about alphabetical strings causing problems in the addition.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was thinking array_product() would have the same behavior as
          array_sum(), and it does with one major difference. If there is a
          non-numeric string in the array, then the product will be zero. Once
          the non-numeric strings are removed from the the array, then the
          product works as expected:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
              $mixed = ["5", 2, "10", 3.3, <strong>"tree"</strong>];
              $product = array_product($mixed);
              echo $product;                    // 0

              $mixed = ["5", 2, "10", 3.3];
              $product = array_product($mixed);
              echo $product;                    // 330
           </pre
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Another interesting array method is array_map(). With array_map(), you
          can pass it a callback function which is applied to every element of
          the array. The first parameter of array_map() is the name of the
          function in parenthesis. Also, I realized that you need to have a
          <em>return statement</em> in the function-- otherwise the array will
          have keys but no values.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
              function cheese($ingredient) {
                return $ingredient = $ingredient . " cheese";         // needs return statement
              }

              $names = ["mozzarella", "swiss", "cheddar", "gouda", "kraft"];

              $returnArray = array_map("cheese", $names);             // function name as first parameter
              print_r($returnArray); 
              
              // Array ( [0] => mozzarella cheese [1] => swiss cheese [2] => cheddar cheese [3] => gouda cheese [4] => kraft cheese )
          </pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The number of array methods in PHP is really impressive. Even with
          just the array_map(), there are many different uses. One way to use it
          is to combine many different array into one multidimensional array by
          setting the first argument to null.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
            $city = ['San Francisco', 'Portland', 'Seattle', 'Las Vegas'];
            $abbreviation = ['CA', 'OR', 'WA', 'NV'];
            $state = ['California', 'Oregon', 'Washington', 'Nevada'];
            $zip = ['94106', '97035', '98101', '88901'];

            $combined = array_map(null, $city, $state, $zip, $abbreviation);

            print_r($combined);
            // Array (  [0] => Array ( [0] => San Francisco [1] => California [2] => 94106 [3] => CA ) 
                        [1] => Array ( [0] => Portland [1] => Oregon [2] => 97035 [3] => OR ) 
                        [2] => Array ( [0] => Seattle [1] => Washington [2] => 98101 [3] => WA ) 
                        [3] => Array ( [0] => Las Vegas [1] => Nevada [2] => 88901 [3] => NV ) 
                      )


            print_r($combined[0]);
            // Array ( [0] => San Francisco [1] => California [2] => 94106 [3] => CA )
          </pre>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The combined array has keys that are associated with values of each
          city. If we just print_r one of the key-value pairs by using
          print_r($combined[0]), then we get the value of the first element
          which is an Array with key-value pairs of San Francisco.
