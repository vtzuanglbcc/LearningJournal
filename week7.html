        <h3>Week 7</h3>
        <p>
          <time datetime="2021-10-15">October 15 2021</time>
        </p>
        <p>
          This week, we created registration and login forms that were connected
          to the database. I found this really exciting and interesting because
          this allows us to create a user in the database, then have the user
          log in with the email and password they created. In doing so, we no
          longer need to use hardcoded passwords to login, but can have a
          changing set of emails and passwords to login. To start doing this, we
          first created a PHP script to connect to the database. This was
          covered in the previous week but it was good to review all the aspects
          of the database connection file. Essentially, we need to connect to a
          database which will contain the table we are accessing. The database
          connection will have a database user name and password, in addition to
          the database host which is set to 127.0.0.1 and the name of the
          database itself. This is all set up in the cPanel mySQL Database area.
          Simply create a database of your liking with your chosen name, then
          link that database to a username and set up a database password for
          that user to access that database.
        </p>
        <p>
          I ended up setting up some more databases for practice as this is new
          to me and it helps to repeat it several times. After setting up the
          database, I also set up the FTP again from Visual Studio Code to the
          FTP server on the cPanel. This allows for near instant upload of files
          to the server after saving the file. To set the sFTP, you need to find
          the FTP host name which is in the FTP area of cPanel. I changed to
          protocol to ftp and the port to 21. The username and password used
          here is different from the database login. It is the credentials used
          to login to cPanel. And the remote path is where the location on the
          server where the files will be synced to on the server. Once this is
          all set up, it makes creating scripts and instantly seeing the changes
          on the webserver simple.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once those two steps are complete, I started to work on the
          registration.php site. This site is not complicated but I did run into
          several bugs along the way. Most notably, I missed a few semicolons
          which took a while to find and also the encryption SHA function the
          textbook uses does not work for me to I tried a different encryption
          function and it seemed to work. In the textbook, the author uses this
          SQL query to add an entry to the database:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
            $query = "INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name, email, pass, registration_date)
	                    VALUES ('$first_name', '$last_name', '$email', SHA2('$pass', 512), NOW() )";

        </pre
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I tried to do this multiple times but it never worked. Eventually, I
          Googled PHP and SHA and I found a function called hash(). I tried
          doing this instead:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
            $hash = hash('sha512', $pass);
            $query = "INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name, email, pass, registration_date)
	                    VALUES ('$first_name', '$last_name', '$email', $hash, NOW() )";

        </pre
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This actually worked and I was able to see a really long alphanumeric
          password in the database for that entry. I don't know if this is the
          correct way to do it but basically the hash() function takes the $pass
          variable and creates a hash using 'sha512' encryption. Then that value
          is stored in $hash and passed into the database query. Hopefully, this
          is an acceptable way to do it. I did find it strange that I could not
          find a PHP manual page about SHA() but I was glad to find a hash()
          function instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of the registration form was alot of checking to make sure
          the user entered in the values. For example, if the user did not enter
          in a first name, then the $errors array would append another message
          by:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
            $errors[] = "You did not enter in a first name.";
        </pre
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The PHP syntax for pushing an entry into the array is very
          interesting! It is simply the name of the array variable with two
          brackets []. If the user did enter in the text entry, then the value
          would be trimmed with the trim() function and then the value could be
          set to the variable to use in the query.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another interesting function that came up was
          mysqli_real_escape_string. I tried to use this to resolve the SHA()
          problems but it wasn't helpful in that specific regard. Instead, the
          mysqli_real_escape_string is helpful in cleaning out special
          characters in a string so the SQL query will run correctly. According
          to the PHP manual, the mysqli_real_escape_string procedural style is
          to have the database connection as the first parameter and the string
          as the second paramter:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
            $first_name = mysqli_real_escape_string($connection, trim($_POST['first_name']));
          
        </pre
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          $connection is the connection between mySQL database and PHP, while
          the trim($_POST['first_name']) is simply a user input string that has
          been trimmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did some experimenting with mysqli_real_escape_string($connection,
          trim($_POST['first_name']));. Essentially, if you omit the
          mysqli_real_escape_string, if the string the user enter has mySQL
          escape sequences, those escape sequences will be interpreted. For
          example, a \n will become a newline, and a \t will become a tab. Thus,
          when I entered in "\n\r\t\\\\Hello" for first_name without
          mysqli_real_escape_string, it became a newline, carriage return, a
          tab, and two backslashes. If I used mysqli_real_escape_string with the
          $connection and string value entered, then it would simply be saved
          into the database uninterpreted as the literal \n\r\t\\\\Hello. I
          thought this was so interesting and so I makes sense to use the
          mysqli_real_escape_string(), because you do not want the user to to
          entering in commands into the input boxes that the computer accidently
          interprets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another example detailed in the book of the important utility of
          mysqli_real_escape_string() was how mysqli_real_escape_string()
          prevents the breaking of the mySQL query to insert values. If the
          user's name was O'brien, the single quote will break the SQL query to
          insert the value. Here is a code fragment:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <pre>
            INSERT INTO USERS (first_name, last_name, email, pass, registration_date) VALUES('O\'brien', 'O'brien', ...
            
         </pre
          >
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The first_name is processed through mysqli_real_escape_string() while
          the last_name is not. This results in a last name of 'O'brien' in the
          SQL query which creates an error in the query. Meanwhile, with
          mysqli_real_escape_string(), the first name's single quote is escaped
          out and the query is able to run successfully ('O\'brien'). Another
          important thing to emphasize is that mysqli_real_escape_string()
          requires a database connection to work, so be sure to import the
          database connection file before calling this function.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another question I had was why go through all this trouble hashing a
          password when you still only use your password to login and not the
          hashed password. I Googled this and it sounds like the purpose of
          hashing is to prevent a database leak from revealing all these
          passwords that are saved in the database. I am guessing it is not
          simple to unhash a password so a hashed password adds complexity to
          determining the password.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of the register.php file was pretty understandable and I
          ended up making mistakes in the echo statements by forgetting to put
          the semicolon at the end of statements. For example, if the user
          forgot to input the first name or last name, a message would be stored
          in the $errors array and then a foreach loop was used to display the
          messages.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also created a file to display all the users in the database. The
          query to complete this was simply to SELECT the name and registration
          date of the users. The query used a CONCAT SQL function to concatenate
          the last name and first name and also the DATE_FORMAT() to present the
          registration date in a well formatted state. AS is used to rename the
          SQL column and it is used later to display the actual data in the
          table.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
		$query = "SELECT CONCAT(last_name, ', ', first_name) AS name,
			    DATE_FORMAT(registration_date, '%M %d, %Y') AS dr
			    FROM USERS
			    ORDER BY registration_date ASC";

		$result = mysqli_query($connection, $query);            

		$num = mysqli_num_rows($result);

             </pre
          >
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The query is then run and we get the number of results returned by
          mysqli_num_rows($result). This is useful because if the number of
          results returned is zero, then there is no need to loop through the
          array returned by the database. If the number of results returned is
          greater than zero, then a table is created to print out the results
          row by row.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
                while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result, MYSQLI_ASSOC)) {
        		echo '<tr><td align="left">' . $row['name'] . '</td><td align="left">' . $row['dr'] . '</td></tr>';
    		}

            </pre>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The last script we went over this week was to update the password of a
          user that has already registered. To do this, we need to have the user
          enter in their email and old password along with a new password and a
          confirm password. If the email and password do not match an entry in
          the database, then we cannot proceed. To check if the email and
          password match an entry in the database, we run a SELECT query for a
          user id that has an email value and password value equal to what the
          user entered.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
	      	$query = "SELECT user_id FROM USERS
          		WHERE (email='$e'  AND pass='$hash') ";
  		</pre
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Here the password is set to equal the hashed value of the password. As
          mentioned above , the SHA() function did not work for me so I used the
          hash() function instead which takes as the first parameter the string
          value of the hash function, and a second parameter as the string that
          you want to hash. If this above query matches one and only one result
          using mysqli_num_rows($result), then we can proceed to change the
          password for the user. To change the password, we make sure the new
          password and confirm password are the same, and then we hash it and
          perform an UPDATE query.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
              	$query = "UPDATE USERS
          	SET pass='$hashnew'
          		WHERE user_id='$row[0]' ";

		$result = @mysqli_query($connection, $query);
            </pre
          >
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          How do we know if the update was successful? We can use the
          mysqli_affected_rows($connection) function which will return a value
          of the number of rows that were affected by the query. In this
          situation, we want the number of affected rows to be equal to 1.
          mysqli_affected_rows($connection) takes a parameter of the database
          connection, and will return the number of affected rows for INSERT,
          UPDATE, and DELETE queries.
        </p>

        <p>
          An important thing to emphasize again is the importance of using
          <b>mysqli_real_escape_string</b>($connection, $_POST['name']) for all
          user input. Again, if the user puts in single quotes or backslashes or
          escape sequences, mysqli_real_escape_string will deal with it
          appropriately and prevent a premature termination of the SQL query--
          especially with the single quotation mark. For the backslashes, if you
          forget to use mysqli_real_escape_string(), they will simply be
          interpreted if they are escape sequences. So "\\" would become "\" and
          "\n" would become a newline.
          <em>Just use the mysqli_real_escape_string()!</em>
        </p>

        <p class="supplemental">Supplemental Learning</p>

        <p>
          This week, I worked on the
          <a href="https://tzuang.webdevstudent.me/add_depts.php"
            >Add Departments Website</a
          >
          and wanted to add some JavaScript into the file. I did supplemental
          learning on addEventListener("click", () => {}) functions to add
          interactivity to the website such that when the user clicks on the
          AutoFill button, the website will automatically fill in values for the
          fields. I used Math.random() extensively to do this, and multiplied
          Math.random() by the length of the array that that held some sample
          Department names. Then Math.floor() was used to create an integer
          index for that array. I did the same for the background color. One
          thing I noticed about embedding JavaScript in PHP is oftentimes, the
          browser will not fetch a new version of JavaScript if it is linked to
          an outside file. Thus, for the background color changer to work, I
          needed to simply type in the JavaScript within the &lt;script&gt; tag
          directly on that PHP page.
