          For this first week of PHP/MySQL, I learned the very basics of PHP. I
          didn't realize previously that PHP required a webserver to function.
          And that PHP code was actually written into a file that very much
          resembles a HTML document, but is saved with the PHP file name
          extension.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a link to what we worked on in
          <a href="https://cosw30-lab1.victortzuang.repl.co/">Week 1</a>. It's a
          website written in PHP that utilizes the PHP echo statement to display
          a website. The echo statements produce the HTML code which is
          displayed. I would like to improve on CSS and I tried to incorporate
          some CSS properties I found on W3Schools into that website.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was very interesting that single and double quotes mean different
          things in PHP. Content within singles quotes are not interpreted but
          instead are displayed literally. For example, in this:
        </p>
        <pre>
                
                  $car = "Camry"; 
                  $color = "blue";
                  echo 'My $car is $color.";
                  echo "My $car is $color.";
                  
        </pre>
        <p>
          the first echo statement will display 'My $car is $color.'. Meanwhile,
          the second echo will display "My Camry is blue".
        </p>

          This week, I went through some of the W3Schools's CSS learning
          materials. I thought the
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border_rounded.asp"
            >border-radius property</a
          >
          was really useful to make rounded borders. There were also some CSS
          topics such as tooltips, font-weight, and font-style. The tooltips I
          felt can be used to make a very artistic website and I hope to utilize
          them. The resize property allows the user to resize an element. The
          property value of resize can be none, both, horizontal, or vertical.
          Here, this div is set for horizontal resizing:
        </p>
        <div class="resize">
          When the CSS resize property is set to horizontal, this div can be
          minimized horizontally but not vertically.
        </div>
