          This week, I reviewed Chapters 1 and 2, especially the content regarding arrays. 
          In PHP, arrays can be written using the shorthand array syntax:
          
          <blockquote>
            <pre>  
              $vegetables = ["tomato", "corn", "peppers"];
              $days = [1 => 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday'];
              $state = [ "CA" => "California", "NV" => "Nevada", "OR" => "Oregon"];
              
            </pre>
          </blockquote>
        
        In the above example, $vegetables has key-value pairs of $vegetables[0] = "tomato",
        $vegetables[1] = "corn", and $vegetables[2] = "peppers". In $days, we specified that
        the key starts with 1, so the key-value pairs would be $days[1] = "Monday", $days[2] = "Tuesday",
        and $days[3] = "Wednesday".
          
        </p>
        <p>
          PHP also has a very useful range() function. We can use range() to create an array of
          numbers. For example
          
         <blockquote><pre>

              $years = range(2021, 2031);
              $age = range(18, 58);
           
           
           </pre></blockquote>
      
      will create an array $years that has the numbers from 2021 to 2031. What is interesting
      is that the <em>last number is included</em> in the range. This can be different from other
      languages, and what comes to mind is Python where the a range(0, 10) does not include 10. 
      For PHP, the $age variable here would produce an array including numbers 18 to 58. 
      </p>
      <p>
      To iterate through the array, the foreach loop is very useful. If only the values of the
        array are needed, then this syntax is used
        
        <blockquote><pre>
              foreach($years as $value) {
                  echo "$value";  
              }
          </pre> </blockquote>
           
        If the keys are needed as well, then this is needed:
    
        <blockquote><pre>
              foreach($state as $key => $value) {
                  echo "$key - $value";
              }
          
          </pre></blockquote>
    
      As a sidenote, the range can also be used to create an array of letters such as 
    <code>range('a', 'm')</code> and <code>is_array()</code> returns whether a variable is an array.
          
          
          
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also quite a few sorting methods that go with arrays. Just four are 
        
        <blockquote><pre>
        
                      
              ksort();
              krsort();
              asort();
              arsort();
        </pre></blockquote>
       
        The "k" stands for key, the "a" stands for value, and "r" indicates descending order. So ksort() sorts
  by key in ascending order, krsort() sorts by key in descending order, asort() sorts by value in ascending order, and
  arsort() sorts by value in descending order.
        
     </p>

     <p> 
        There is also the explode(separator, $string) which returns an array by separating a 
       string by a specified separator. The opposite is implode(glue, $array) which produces
       a string by joining together the elements of an array by using a glue string.
       
       
     </p>
     <p>
       Another aspect of PHP arrays is that if the keys of an array are strings, you need to use curly braces to
       echo the value array element. For example, the curly braces here are required
       
       <blockquote><pre>
              echo "The state is <strong>{</strong>$state['CA']<strong>}</strong>";
       </pre></blockquote>

          This week I read about the CSS that goes into making tooltips. While visiting various sites such
           as Youtube or Google, I noticed how stylized tooltips are used prevalently. I think the thing that
           confused me when learning about tooltips is the use of the position property. The position property
           often is set to relative or absolute. Relative is relative to the viewport or where it is normally 
           positioned, and absolute is compared to its closest ancestor. So how does this apply to tooltips? 
           
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the tooltip text occurs in the HTML code after the tooltip container, the tooltip text will
          have an absolute position that is absolute to the tooltip container. The positioning of the tooltip
          text uses top, bottom, left and right. How I like to think of this is how far from the top will the tooltip
          text be at? If it is further from the top, then that would mean increasing positive values for top. Here is
          a sample tooltip: </p>

      <p>
        <div class="tooltip">  <a href="week2.html">Week 2</a>
          <span class="tooltiptext">Read Week 2 Journal Entry</span></div>
      </p>
      <p>
          Here, the tooltip text is actually coded into the HTML but is hidden by CSS. Only after the mouse hovers over
        the div with class tooltip is the text actually displayed and the visibility is set to visible instead of hidden. The
        CSS <em>pseudo-class</em> selector used is tooltip:hover.
        
      </p>
