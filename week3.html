          This week, I reviewed Chapters 1 and 2, especially the content regarding arrays. 
          In PHP, arrays can be written using the shorthand array syntax:
          
          <blockquote>
            <code>  
              $vegetables = ["tomato", "corn", "peppers"];
              $days = [1 => 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday'];
              $state = [ "CA" => "California", "NV" => "Nevada", "OR" => "Oregon"];
              
            </code>
          </blockquote>
        
        In the above example, $vegetables has key-value pairs of $vegetables[0] = "tomato",
        $vegetables[1] = "corn", and $vegetables[2] = "peppers". In $days, we specified that
        the key starts with 1, so the key-value pairs would be $days[1] = "Monday", $days[2] = "Tuesday",
        and $days[3] = "Wednesday".
          
        </p>
        <p>
          PHP also has a very useful range() function. We can use range() to create an array of
          numbers. For example
          
         <blockquote><code>
           $years = range(2021, 2031);
           $age = range(18, 58);
           
           
           </blockquote></code>
      
      will create an array $years that has the numbers from 2021 to 2031. What is interesting
      is that the <em>last number is included</em> in the range. This can be different from other
      languages, and what comes to mind is Python where the a range(0, 10) does not include 10. 
      For PHP, the $age variable here would produce an array including numbers 18 to 58. 
      </p>
      <p>
      To iterate through the array, the foreach loop is very useful. If only the values of the
        array are needed, then this syntax is used
        
        <blockquote><pre>
            foreach($years as $value) {
                echo "$value";  
            }
          </pre> </blockquote>
           
        If the keys are needed as well, then this is needed:
    
        <blockquote><pre>
              foreach($state as $key => $value) {
                  echo "$key - $value";
              }
          
          </pre></blockquote>
    
      As a sidenote, the range can also be used to create an array of letters such as 
      range('a', 'm') and is_array() returns whether a variable is an array.
