          This second week of PHP/MySQL was an exciting adventure
          into what happens after you submit a HTML form. Previously, the
          story of HTML forms basically ended here after clicking the
          "submit" button:
        </p>
        <code>
          <form action="process_form.php" method="post">
            <h4>Subscribe to Our Email List</h4>
            <p>Enter your first name: <input type="text" name="firstname" required></p>
            <p>Enter your email address: <input type="email" name="email" required></p>
            <p>Select your interests:</p>
            <input type="checkbox" id="eggplant" name="vegetables[]" value="eggplant">Eggplant<br>
            <input type="checkbox" id="peppers" name="vegetables[]" value="peppers">Peppers<br>
            <input type="checkbox" id="potatoes" name="vegetables[]" value="potatoes">Potatoes<br>     
            <input type="checkbox" id="tomatoes" name="vegetables[]" value="tomatoes">Tomatoes<br><br>  
            <input type="submit" value="Subscribe">
         </code>
         <p>
            Now, with PHP, the story is just starting with clicking of the Subscribe
           button. PHP takes the information provided in this form and then processes the 
           data. This week we delved into the how the <code>action</code> and <code>method</code>
           attribute of the HTML form sends the data in the form to the server, and how PHP
           works with that data. For example, this code:
         </p>
         <blockquote><code>
            &lt;form action=&quot;process_form.php&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
         </code></blockquote>
         <p>
           tells us that the form data is sent to "process_form.php" to process the data and
           that the "post" method is used rather than "get".
         </p>
         <p>
           When the data is sent to "process_form.php", the information entered by the user 
           is then accessible to the server through the <code>$_POST['firstname']</code> and
           <code>$_POST['email']</code> variables.These values can then be used in various ways, such
           outputting it to the user:
         </p>
         <blockquote><code>
           $firstName = $_POST['firstname'];
           $email = $_POST['email'];
           echo "Thank you for subscribing to our Email Subscriber List, $firstName<br>\n";
           echo "We will send emails to $email<br>\n";
         </code></blockquote>
    </main>
