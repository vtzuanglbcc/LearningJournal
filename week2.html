          This second week of PHP/MySQL was an exciting adventure
          into what happens after you submit a HTML form. Previously, the
          story of HTML forms basically ended here after clicking the
          "submit" button:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <form action="process_form.php" method="post">
            <h4>Subscribe to Our Email List</h4>
            <p>Enter your first name: <input type="text" name="firstname" required></p>
            <p>Enter your email address: <input type="email" name="email" required></p>
            <p>Select your interests:</p>
            <input type="checkbox" id="eggplant" name="vegetables[]" value="eggplant">Eggplant<br>
            <input type="checkbox" id="peppers" name="vegetables[]" value="peppers">Peppers<br>
            <input type="checkbox" id="potatoes" name="vegetables[]" value="potatoes">Potatoes<br>     
            <input type="checkbox" id="tomatoes" name="vegetables[]" value="tomatoes">Tomatoes<br><br>  
            <input type="submit" value="Subscribe">
            <p><bold>Note</bold>: unfortunately, it appears GitHub Pages does not allow server processing of PHP, and 
              will output <code><bold>405 Not Allowed</bold></code>
            </p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>
            Now, with PHP, the story is just starting with clicking of the Subscribe
           button. PHP takes the information provided in this form and then processes the 
           data. This week we delved into the how the <code>action</code> and <code>method</code>
           attribute of the HTML form sends the data in the form to the server, and how PHP
           works with that data. For example, this code:
         </p>
         <blockquote><code>
            &lt;form action=&quot;process_form.php&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
         </code></blockquote>
         <p>
           tells us that the form data is sent to "process_form.php" to process the data and
           that the "post" method is used rather than "get".
         </p>
         <p>
           When the data is sent to "process_form.php", the information entered by the user 
           is then accessible to the server through the <code>$_POST['firstname']</code> and
           <code>$_POST['email']</code> variables.These values can then be used in various ways, such
           outputting it to the user:
         </p>
         <blockquote><pre>
           $firstName= $_POST['firstname'];
           $email = $_POST['email'];
           echo "Thank you for subscribing to our Email Subscriber List, $firstName>&lt;br&gt;\n";
           echo "We will send emails to $email&lt;br&gt;\n";
         </pre></blockquote>
         <p>
           Finally, we also reviewed the important difference between double and single quotes in PHP.
           In the previous block of code, if the echo statement used single quotes, then the $firstName
           and $email variables would not have been interpreted to their values, and instead would 
           have just been printed as the string $firstName and $email. For their <em>values</em> to be 
           printed, either use double quotes, or use single quotes and the concatenation "." operator 
           which is the period.

         <p>
           This week, I read online about the checkbox input type above and how the name attribute of the related
           checkboxes should have a array name. For example:
         </p>
         <blockquote><pre>
            &lt;input type="checkbox" id="eggplant" name="vegetables[]" value="eggplant"&gt;Eggplant<br>
            &lt;input type="checkbox" id="peppers" name="vegetables[]" value="peppers"&gt;Peppers<br>
         </pre></blockquote>
         <p>
            The name attribute is set to vegetables[] rather than vegetables, so that when the PHP processes the vegetables,
            it will not be just one string value such as "peppers", but instead an array of strings which could include "eggplant",
            "peppers", and other values.
         </p>
