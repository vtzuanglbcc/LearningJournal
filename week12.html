        <h3>Week 12</h3>
        <p>
          <time datetime="2021-11-19">November 19 2021</time>
        </p>

        <p>
          This week, we launched into working with our groups for our coffee
          shop website project. It was a great experience and definitely had
          unique challenges along the way. I really enjoyed communicating with
          fellow team members about the design, layout, and programming of the
          website. One of the challenges we had was making sure we were all
          working with the same code and not overwriting other teammate's
          changes. We ended up coming up with a system where people would work
          on their files and communicate through Discord what they were working
          on. We also made sure to only upload files that we were specifically
          working on, rather than syncing the whole folder which would overwrite
          new changes that we could be unaware of.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the start of the project, all the team members focused on different
          aspects of the website. I started with setting up the database and the
          tables in the database. The four tables included a table for users,
          products, categories, and orders. I also set up foreign keys between
          the products and categories tables, and foreign keys between the
          users, products, and orders tables. The products would have a
          category_id foreign key, while the category table would have
          category_id as the primary key. Meanwhile, the orders table would have
          user_id and product_id as foreign keys, while the user_id would be the
          primary key in the user table and the product_id would be the primary
          key in the product table.
        </p>
        <p>
          After creating the tables, I wanted to create test pages to try to
          update the tables with information. This involved creating an user
          registration page to add users to the database. After this page
          worked, I tried to help with the login page to get to connected with
          the database correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also focused on working on the create-read-update-delete aspect of
          the products. This involved creating the add products page, view
          products page, and the edit products page. The
          <img src="edit_products.PNG" width="600" />edit products page
          currently contains the most information with all the current fields in
          the products database table displayed. This page has limited sorting
          capability when you click on the table headers. Also, the pages are
          numbered so that only 10 listings are shown per page and you can click
          on the numbered pages or on “Next” or “Previous” to go forward or
          backward. When you click on the name of a product such as “Hot
          Coffee”, you are taken to edit_single_product.php page which lets you
          edit nearly all the fields of the product. I decided to omit the image
          field and category type at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The edit products table could be improved by better CSS styling. I
          mainly focused on getting the PHP and mySQL queries to work correctly
          and to display the data in a table format. However, we could
          definitely improve the table styling and readability.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked on the add products page but it does not yet have all the
          newly added fields in the products table. I will try to add all the
          fields into the add products page such as uploading images and coffee
          ingredients and origin input fields.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will also continue to work on the view products page. The page
          currently consists of a flex display with cards representing each
          product. I would like to add the product image to each card and to add
          more data displayed to each of those cards. Since upgrading the fields
          in the products database table, it is definitely possible to add
          product information such as the ingredients, calories, image, origin,
          and serving size to the view products page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, I would also like to try to build out the categories
          create-read-update-delete pages. I think these can be patterned after
          the pages from the products.
        </p>
        <p class="supplemental">Supplemental Learning</p>
        <p>
          This week, I was trying to research how to style content where when
          the user scrolls down the page, the content changes opacity from 0 to
          1 and transforms upward. I was not able to figure out definitively how
          to do this but it seems to involve JavaScript and trying to determine
          the window position and the div top and bottom location. So while that
          attempt to learn that content did not completely work out, I did end
          up learning about transforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Transforms are a really amazing property that move the location of an
          object. For example, when you hover over a button, you can set its
          transform to translateY(1em), which causes the button to move down
          1em. Then, on the CSS of the original item, you set a transition with
          the value of transform, 500ms, which causes the transform to complete
          over half a second. Here is an example which works when you hover over
          the button.
        </p>

        <div id="button">
          <button>Hover</button>
        </div>
