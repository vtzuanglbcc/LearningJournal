        <h3>Week 5</h3>
        <p>
          <time datetime="2021-10-01">October 1 2021</time>
        </p>
        <p>
          This week I reviewed sticky forms which allows the user to not need
          to retype or reenter form input in case the form is incomplete
          and needs additional information. The fields that the user has already
          entered are maintained while a message is displayed to the user informing
          them that other fields still need to be completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oftentimes, these forms are submitted back to itself using the its 
          same name as the action. Here, the action is set to "form.php":
          
        </p>
        <blockquote><pre>
            &lt;form action="form.php" method="POST&gt;
        </pre></blockquote>
        <p>
          For this to work, the form.php needs to check whether the user has input
          information yet. This is done by checking whether the server request method
          is POST or not:
          
        </p>
        <blockquote><pre>
            if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
               $problem = false;
               
               if (empty($_POST['first_name'])) {
                  echo "&lt;Please enter in first name&gt;";
               }
            
              if (!$problem) {
                  echo "&lt;Great! Thank you for submitting the information.&gt;";
                  $_POST = []         // clear the POST variables
              }
            }
        </pre></blockquote>
        <p>
          A thank you message is displayed when the form is completed and the
          POST variables above are also then cleared. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to make the form sticky, the following code needs to be inserted
          into value attribute in the input tag of the form for first name:
        </p>
        <blockquote><pre>
            &lt;?php
                if (isset($_POST['first_name'])) {
                echo htmlspecialchars($_POST['first_name']);
                }
            ?&gt;
        </pre></blockquote>
        <p>
            For textareas, the php needs to echo directly into the space between
          the opening and closing textarea tags. 
          
          
        </p>  
        <blockquote><pre>
            &lt;textarea name="comments"&gt;&lt;?php
                if (isset($_POST['comments'])) {
                  echo htmlspecialchars($_POST['comments']);
                }
          
            ?&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
          
        </pre></blockquote>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, for select drop down menus, the php needs to echo "selected" into the opening
          option tag if the $_POST['day'] isset() and if that value equals the variable $i in the
          for loop.
        </p>
       
        <blockquote><pre>
            &lt;select name="day"&gt;
            &lt;?php
                for($i = 1; $i <= 30; $i++) {
                    echo "&lt;option value='$i'"; 
          
                    if (isset($_POST['day']) && $_POST['day'] == $i) {
                      echo " selected";
                    }
          
                    echo "&gt;$i&lt;/option&gt;";
                }
            ?&gt;
            &lt;/select&gt;
         </pre></blockquote>
         
          
          <p>
            For input of type radio and checkbox, the php needs to echo "checked" into the input tag. 
            This is similar to input of type text except for in type text, the php echos into the value
            attribute using echo htmlspecialchars($_POST['last_name']).
          </p>

            While exploring different PHP array functions, array_intersect looked like it could be
            quite useful if you wanted to find all the elements that are shared between two arrays.
            The return value is an Array that contains the shared values and the keys are based on the
            keys of the first array argument. So if you reverse the arguments, then the keys will
            be different unless the positions of the values are the same in both arrays. Here is 
            an example:
            
          </p>
          <blockquote><pre>
                $ingredients = ["chocolate chip", "sugar", "peanut butter", "almond" ,"coffee", "tea", "butter", "strawberry"];
                $icecream = ["chocolate chip", "vanilla", "coffee", "strawberry"];

                $intersect = array_intersect($ingredients, $icecream);
                print_r($intersect);                          //Array ( [0] => chocolate chip [4] => coffee [7] => strawberry ) 

                $intersect = array_intersect($icecream, $ingredients);
                print_r($intersect);                          // Array ( [0] => chocolate chip [2] => coffee [3] => strawberry )
          </pre></blockquote>
          <p>
            I think array_intersect() would be useful if you wanted to find matching values in
            two arrays and you wanted to easily work with those values. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Array_sum() caught my attention and I thought it could be very useful:
          </p>
          <blockquote><pre>
                $icecream = ["chocolate chip", "vanilla", "coffee", "strawberry"];
                $sum = array_sum($icecream);
                echo $sum;                            // 0

                $mixed = ["apple", 3, 4, 5, "cherry", 10];
                $sum = array_sum($mixed);
                echo $sum;                            // 22

                $mixed = ["tree", 3.1415, -22, 100, "hello", "world", "50", "1000"];
                $sum = array_sum($mixed);
                echo $sum;                            // 1131.1415
          </pre></blockquote>
          <p>
            When the array is all alphabetical strings, then the array_sum() returns zero on that
            array. Then, I tried mixed type arrays and it appears to only add the integers. 
            Finally, I had a mixed array with strings, float, integers, and also strings like "50"
            which can be converted to numbers. It turns out PHP converts these numeric strings
            into numbers, and adds them to the sum as well. This behavior is very interesting and
            may be useful especially in adding together user input that may all be in strings. 
            This means you do not need to convert user string input into numbers to add them, yet
            you do not need to worry about alphabetical strings causing problems in the addition.
          </p>
          <p>
             I was thinking array_product() would have the same behavior as array_sum(), and it does
          with one major difference. If there is a non-numeric string in the array, then the product
          will be zero. Once the non-numeric strings are removed from the the array, then the product
          works as expected:
          </p>
          <blockquote><pre>
                $mixed = ["5", 2, "10", 3.3, <strong>"tree"</strong>];
                $product = array_product($mixed);
                echo $product;                    // 0

                $mixed = ["5", 2, "10", 3.3];
                $product = array_product($mixed);
                echo $product;                    // 330
           </pre></blockquote>
           <p>
             Another interesting array method is array_map(). With array_map(), you can pass it
             a callback function which is applied to every element of the array. The first 
             parameter of array_map() is the name of the function in parenthesis. Also, I realized
             that you need to have a <em>return statement</em> in the function-- otherwise the array will
             have keys but no values. 
          </p>
          <blockquote><pre>
                  function cheese($ingredient) {
                    return $ingredient = $ingredient . " cheese";         // needs return statement
                  }

                  $names = ["mozzarella", "swiss", "cheddar", "gouda", "kraft"];

                  $returnArray = array_map("cheese", $names);             // function name as first parameter
                  print_r($returnArray); 
                  
                  // Array ( [0] => mozzarella cheese [1] => swiss cheese [2] => cheddar cheese [3] => gouda cheese [4] => kraft cheese )
          </pre></blockquote>
          <p>
            The number of array methods in PHP is really impressive. Even with just the array_map(), there
            are many different uses. One way to use it is to combine many different array into one 
            multidimensional array by setting the first argument to null.
          </p>
          <blockquote><pre>
                $city = ['San Francisco', 'Portland', 'Seattle', 'Las Vegas'];
                $abbreviation = ['CA', 'OR', 'WA', 'NV'];
                $state = ['California', 'Oregon', 'Washington', 'Nevada'];
                $zip = ['94106', '97035', '98101', '88901'];

                $combined = array_map(null, $city, $state, $zip, $abbreviation);

                print_r($combined);
                // Array (  [0] => Array ( [0] => San Francisco [1] => California [2] => 94106 [3] => CA ) 
                            [1] => Array ( [0] => Portland [1] => Oregon [2] => 97035 [3] => OR ) 
                            [2] => Array ( [0] => Seattle [1] => Washington [2] => 98101 [3] => WA ) 
                            [3] => Array ( [0] => Las Vegas [1] => Nevada [2] => 88901 [3] => NV ) 
                         )


                print_r($combined[0]);
                // Array ( [0] => San Francisco [1] => California [2] => 94106 [3] => CA )
          </pre></blockquote>
          <p>
            The combined array has keys that are associated with values of each city. If we
            just print_r one of the key-value pairs by using print_r($combined[0]), then
            we get the value of the first element which is an Array with key-value pairs of San
            Francisco.
