        <h3>Week 5</h3>
        <p>
          <time datetime="2021-10-01">October 1 2021</time>

        <p>
          This week we learned about sticky forms which allows the user to not need
          to retype or reenter form input in case the form is incomplete
          and needs additional information. The fields that the user has already
          entered are maintained while a message is displayed to the user informing
          them that other fields still need to be completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oftentimes, these forms are submitted back to itself using the its 
          same name as the action. Here, the action is set to "form.php":
          
        </p>
        <blockquote><pre>
            &lt;form action="form.php" method="POST&gt;
        </pre></blockquote>
        <p>
          For this to work, the form.php needs to check whether the user has input
          information yet. This is done by checking whether the server request method
          is POST or not:
          
        </p>
        <blockquote><pre>
            if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
               $problem = false;
               
               if (empty($_POST['first_name'])) {
                  echo "&lt;p&gt;Please enter in first name&lt;/p&gt;";
               }
            
              if (!$problem) {
                  echo "&lt;p&gt;Great! Thank you for submitting the information.&lt;/p&gt;";
                  $_POST = []         // clear the POST variables
              }
            }
        </pre></blockquote>
        <p>
          A thank you message is displayed when the form is completed and the
          POST variables above are also then cleared. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to make the form sticky, the following code needs to be inserted
          into value attribute in the input tag of the form for first name:
        </p>
        <blockquote><pre>
            &lt;?php
                if (isset($_POST['first_name'])) {
                echo htmlspecialchars($_POST['first_name']);
                }
            ?&gt;
        </pre></blockquote>
        <p>
            For textareas, the php needs to echo directly into the space between
          the opening and closing textarea tags. 
          
          
        </p>  
        <blockquote><pre>
            &lt;textarea name="comments"&gt;&lt;?php
                if (isset($_POST['comments'])) {
                  echo htmlspecialchars($_POST['comments']);
                }
          
            ?&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
          
        </pre></blockquote>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, for select drop down menus, the php needs to echo "selected" into the opening
          option tag if the $_POST['day'] isset() and if that value equals the variable $i in the
          for loop.
        </p>
       
        <blockquote><pre>
            &lt;select name="day"&gt;
            &lt;?php
                for($i = 1; $i <= 30; $i++) {
                    echo "&lt;option value='$i'"; 
          
                    if (isset($_POST['day']) && $_POST['day'] == $i) {
                      echo " selected";
                    }
          
                    echo "&gt;$i&lt;/option&gt;";
                }
            ?&gt;
            &lt;/select&gt;
         </pre></blockquote>
         
          
          <p>
            For input of type radio and checkbox, the php needs to echo "checked" into the input tag. 
            This is similar to input of type text except for in type text, the php echos into the value
            attribute using echo htmlspecialchars($_POST['last_name']).
          </p>

           It was very interesting looking through the functions section of the PHP Manual and learning by
            reading it and also trying out some code in Replit. One thing I got mistaken at first was 
            adding a $ in front of the function name. Function names do not need a $. In this example,
            I thought it was useful how echo can string together multiple values with a comma:
            
          </p>
          <blockquote><pre>
                  $myArray = [1,2,3,4,5];

                  function add($array) {
                  echo "adding last two elements: ", $array[count($array)-2] + $array[count($array) -1];
                  }

                  add($myArray);        //  echos the value "adding last two elements: 9"
          </pre></blockquote>
          <p>
            If you have default values to parameters to a function, it's best to put 
            them last in the parameter list.
            
          </p>
         
          <blockquote><pre>
                function bakeCookie($firstCookie, $secondCookie, $thirdCookie="chocolate chip") {
                    echo "\nBaking $firstCookie, $secondCookie, and $thirdCookie cookies today!";
                }

                bakeCookie("butter", "Sugar", "peanut butter");     // Baking butter, Sugar, and peanut butter cookies today!
                bakeCookie("butter", "sugar");                      // Baking butter, sugar, and chocolate chip cookies today!
          </pre></blockquote>
          <p>
            The manual also mentioned passing by reference values to a function by using an ampersand &.
            Typically, when a variable is passed to a function, once the function is done, the variable
            returns back to its original value. When an ampersand is used, the variable value may be changed
            by the function and that change persists after the function. PHP calls this passing 
            a value by reference. Here, the bank account starts with 1000. When it is passed to the function
            annualAccountFee, the & causes the bankAccount to be passed as reference, and the bankAccount
            variable is decreased by 10 to 990:
          </p>
          <blockquote><pre>
                function annualAccountFee (&$account) {
                  $account = $account - 10;
                }

                $bankAccount = 1000;
                annualAccountFee($bankAccount);
                echo $bankAccount;                // 990
          
          </pre></blockquote>
          
          <p>
             PHP functions can also work with a arguments that are of different lengths.
             This works by using the ... in the function parameter and also in the function
              call if the argument passed is an array. Also, foreach is important here too
              to loop through the arguments that are passed to the function.
          </p>
          <blockquote><pre>
          
               function addAll(...$values) {
                  $sum = 0;

                  foreach($values as $v) {
                    $sum += $v;
                  }

                  return $sum;
              }

              $numbers = [10,20,30,100,70];
              echo addAll(...$numbers);     // 230

              echo "\n";
              echo addAll(5,10,200,100);    // 315
              
           </pre></blockquote>
           <p>
             Functions can also be not named and be anonymous. They can also be set
             to variables and their values used as variables. The PHP manual mentioned
             closures which can retain the value of variables from their enclosing scope.
