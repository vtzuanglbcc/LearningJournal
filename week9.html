        <p>
          This week was a great learning experience with sending email and
          uploading files with PHP. I was surprised how easy it was to send an
          email using PHP. Email is sent simply using the mail() function, with
          the parameters to, subject, and body. The to is an email address to
          send the email to. The subject is the email's subject line, and the
          body is the text of the email. An example of this is as follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
                  $to = 'webdevstudent@emailstudent.co';
                  $subject = 'Thanks for Registering';
                  $body = 'Hello Student. Thank you for registering.
                  &#9; This email confirms your registration';
                  $body = wordwrap($body, 75);

                  mail($to, $subject, $body);
 </pre
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The wordwrap() function will wrap lines when the line exceeds a
          specified number of characters. In the example above, the contents of
          $body will be wrapped to a new line with a newline when the line
          exceeds 75 characters. According to the textbook, the mail() function
          does not send email, but actually tells the mail server to send the
          email. Because of this, there must be a functioning mail server for
          this to successfully work. You can also add another parameter to
          mail() which is for additional headers. Additional headers could be
          From, Bcc, Reply-To and if you choose to use multiple, just separate
          them with \r\n.
        </p>
        <p>
          The textbook delves into a very useful PHP function called phpinfo()
          which displays all the PHP information from the server. It provides a
          wealth of information about the PHP settings and can be helpful to
          determine and adjust settings for file upload and other features. For
          example, file_uploads should be turned On and other settings include
          upload_max_filesize and post_max_size. The php.ini file can be used to
          adjust the settings. However, since I am using a hosted server, I do
          not believe I can make changes to the php.ini file.
        </p>
        <p>
          To upload files with PHP, we need to code for a form with HTML and set
          its enctype to “multipart/form-data” along with a action and method.
          There is also an input with type “hidden” and name with
          “MAX_FILE_SIZE” with value of “1000000” for 1MB. Lastly, we have an
          input of type file and a name so that we can access the file with
          $_FILES variables. The enctype is mandatory for file uploads. The
          enctype is in the from tag and allows to form to handle many types of
          data such as files. The “MAX_FILE_SIZE” is in bytes and needs to be
          before the file input. Lastly, the input with type file makes the
          button to upload a file.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
                  &lt;form enctype= “multipart/form=data”  action= “register.php” method= “POST”&gt;
                  &lt;input type= “hidden” name= “MAX_FILE_SIZE” value= “1000000”&gt;
                  Upload File &lt;input type= “file” name= “upload”&gt;
</pre
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          $_FILES superglobal variable is an array of values very useful for
          working with the uploaded file. If the value of the name in the input
          tag is 'upload', then $_FILES['upload'] refers to this uploaded file.
          To access the elements of this array, you can use
          $_FILES['upload']['name'], $_FILES['upload']['type'],
          $FILES['upload']['size'], $FILES['upload']['tmp_name'], and
          $FILES['upload']['error']. 'name' is the file's original name while
          'tmp_name' is its temporary name on the server. 'error' are error
          codes of the uploaded file while 'size' is the the size in bytes of
          the file and 'type' is the file type such as image/jpeg, image/png, or
          text/javascript. Here is a list of
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types"
            >MIME</a
          >
          types.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the file is received by the PHP, you need to use the
          move_uploaded_file() function to move it to a folder from its
          temporary location. The two parameters of move_uploaded_file() are the
          temporary file name and the path to the folder you want to move the
          file to. Thus, it would look like this:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
	move_uploaded_file($_FILES['upload']['tmp_name'], “uploadsfolder/{$_FILES['upload']['name']}”);
</pre
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The textbook notes that it is important to check that the file was
          successfully moved, so you want to wrap it in an if-statement.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
	if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES['upload']['tmp_name'], “uploadsfolder/{$_FILES['upload']['name']}”);
 </pre
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Here, the file is moved to the uploadsfolder which is at the same
          level as the PHP file the user is at, and the file is moved to the
          uploadsfolder and saved with the same filename as it was when uploaded
          by the user. The textbook says it is better to save the file with a
          different filename but this would require using a database to save
          both the old and new name. I was wondering why you would need to save
          both names, because if the names are saved the same in the database
          and in the filesystem, I would think that is enough for the database
          to retrieve that named file on the filesystem. Perhaps it would be
          useful to have the old file name to be aware if the user is uploading
          the same file and prevent overwriting of the same file, although I am
          not completely certain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book goes over the error codes for $_FILES['upload']['error'],
          with 'upload' again being the value of the name input tag with type as
          file. The error codes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8. Zero means there was no
          error in uploading the file. A switch statement is very useful in
          dealing with the error codes:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
                switch ($_FILES['upload']['error']) {
                  case 1:
                    echo 'File exceeds upload_max_filesize in php.ini';
                    break;
                  case 2:
                    echo 'File exceeds MAX_FILE_SIZE in HTML form';
                    break;
                  …

                  default:
                    echo 'Default error in uploading file';
                    break;
                }
 </pre
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>The break; is needed to prevent fallthrough in PHP.</p>
        <p>
          Another important function is is_uploaded_file(). I was reading on the
          PHP manual that this is important to ward off malicious users.
          is_uploaded_file() takes the parameter of the temporary file name, and
          returns true if the is indeed an uploaded file.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
                  if ( is_uploaded_file($_FILES['upload']['tmp_name']) ) {
                    echo $_FILES['upload']['name'] . ' was uploaded';
                  } else {
                    echo 'Caution: File not uploaded';
                  }

        <p class="supplemental">Supplemental Learning</p>
        <p>
          This week I wanted to learn CSS flexbox and the cards design. I was
          able to use it for the
          <a href="https://tzuang.webdevstudent.me/hw6/list_users.php"
            >homework</a
          >
          this week and it allowed me to easily lay down tiles for registered
          users. Before learning flexbox, I was thinking of all these
          unnecessarily complicated ways to lay images down in a tile going from
          left to right and down from top to bottom. I was thinking of having a
          count variable in PHP and adding 1 for each user, and if the modulus 3
          of it had a remainder of 0, then it would be the first item of that
          row, and if it had a remainder of 1, it would be the middle item, and
          if the remainder was 2, it would be the right item. Meanwhile, if the
          modulus was zero, then it would start a new row. Thus, the page would
          be laid out with 3 items per row going from top to bottom. I was
          thinking this could possibly work, but it does seem so unnecessarily
          difficult. It would involve loops, and since you don't know how many
          items there are at any one time since you could always have new
          registered users, then it would probably need a while loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily, there is CSS flexbox. CSS flexbox was the layout I wanted
          without all the complicated PHP logic. Basically, you have a div
          container with display set to flex. Then all the items in the
          container are laid out depending on the settings you give to that
          container. If my div has class of container, then here was my CSS:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>
                  div.container {
                    display: flex;
                    flex-direction: row;
                    flex-wrap: wrap;
                    justify-content: space-evenly;
                  }
 </pre
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The display:flex tells CSS that this div container is a flex container
          and its children can be moved around based on the flex settings. The
          flex-direction:row means the children are laid out horizontally with
          the row as its main axis. The flex-wrap: wrap means that the children
          in this case will move onto the next row instead of trying to be all
          on the same row. And justify-content: space-evenly means that the
          children will be spaced evenly on the main-axis row. Within this div
          container, I placed a number of div children and I set the div
          children to a fixed width and height. Thus, then the children reached
          the end of the row, they would wrap into the next row.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would say I am a visual learner and this
          <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/"
            >website</a
          >
          was really helpful in visually showing the flexbox properties and what
          the container and children look like.
